## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### MUI

[MUI](https://mui.com) is a React component library for Material UI based off of Google's components. 

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, this Repl will run the `npm start` command, which runs `npm run dev`. In the package.json you can change this to run `npm run stable` which will build and serve the files.
